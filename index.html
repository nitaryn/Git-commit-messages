    <h3>The seven rules of a great git commit message</h3>
    <ol>
    <li> <b>Separate subject from body with a blank line</b>-It's a good idea to begin the commit message with a single shortline summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git.This is not necessary as some commits may require just a single line of sentence</li><br>
<li><b>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</b>-Great commit summaries are 50 characters or less.Place extra informaton in the extended description. </li><br>
        <li> <b>Capitalize the subject line</b>-Begin every subject line with a capital letter.</li><br>
        <li><b>Do not end the subject line with a period</b>-Punctuations are unnecessary in subject lines,hence avoid using them.</li>

   </ol>
