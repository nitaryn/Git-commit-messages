    <h3>The seven rules of a great git commit message</h3>
    <ol>
    <li> <b>Separate subject from body with a blank line</b>-It's a good idea to begin the commit message with a single shortline summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git.This is not necessary as some commits may require just a single line of sentence</li><br>
<li><b>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</b>-Great commit summaries are 50 characters or less.Place extra informaton in the extended description. </li><br>
        <li> <b>Capitalize the subject line</b>-Begin every subject line with a capital letter.</li><br>
        <li><b>Do not end the subject line with a period</b>-Punctuations are unnecessary in subject lines,hence avoid using them.</li><br>
        <li><b> Use the imperative mood in the subject line</b>-The subject line will ensure that it is written or spoken as giving a command or instruction then the body can relax this restriction.</li><br>
        <li><b>Wrap the body at 72 characters</b>-One should use the right margin and ensure that the text wraps manually.Hence 72 characters are recommended so that git has plenty of room to indent text while still keeping everything under 80 characters overall.</li>
