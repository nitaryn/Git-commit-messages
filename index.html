    <h3>The seven rules of a great git commit message</h3>
    <ol>
    <li> <b>Separate subject from body with a blank line</b>-It's a good idea to begin the commit message with a single shortline summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git.This is not necessary as some commits may require just a single line of sentence</li>
    </ol>
